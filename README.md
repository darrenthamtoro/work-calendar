# about
* In this project, we are given starter codes for html and css files. Our job is to edit the html code and create a new JavaScript file to create an event calendar. The use of this event-scheduling calendar is to make people's lives easier because they are able to input any events into the calendar as a reminder. It works like a daily planner. 

* When we open the planner, it brings us to a page where it displays the current day on top of a calendar, and below the calendar is a timeblock showing standard business hours. The timeblock is also made of colors which would indicate whether it is present, past, or the future. The user's would also be able to press the timeblock and can register an event. The scheduled event would be stored in a local storage so even if the user refreshes the page, the event would still be there.
